For those interested in the micro:bit and finding more tutorials and information on new micro:bit accessories and kits, the latest issue 3 is [free for download](https://micromag.cc/).

I re-wrote the first part of my [microbit 2-way radio example tutorial](/python/microbit_radio_example1.md) for issue 3. There's also 9 other micro:bit projects to make, including a tutorial from [Tanya Fish](https://twitter.com/tanurai) of Pimoroni, for making add-on boards from household materials. You can find the issue 3 [list here](https://micromag.cc/issuethree/). The other issues are available to download for free [here](https://micromag.cc/issues/).

Of special interest in that issue, is some information on the recent MakeCode updates, and an article on the new [BittyWeb software](https://www.bittysoftware.com/bittyweb/index.php). This is a web version of their Bitty Software that runs on mobile devices, to collect information from the micro:bit (no relation to the Little Britain sketch, as far as I can tell).
