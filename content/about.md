Since our local code club initially only ran once a week, this blog started as a way to provide more detail than could be covered per session.
Hopefully the extra information helps those who are keen to learn more and are excited to work on even more interesting projects.
The is as much for those wanting to run a similar Club/Maker Group as it is for students/participants.
