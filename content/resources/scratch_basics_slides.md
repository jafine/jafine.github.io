I threw together a slide deck a while back, for our Code Club, to go through  some of the Scratch command blocks we used during 3rd semester. We used this at the start of one of our sessions, and got the kids to explain what commands did, and when they would use them. There's a few at the end, that we hadn't used, put in just to keep it interesting and stimulate a bit of learning.

Just in case it might be useful for other Code Clubs, I've provided a link to download it [here](/pdfs/term3_scratch_roundup.pdf).
